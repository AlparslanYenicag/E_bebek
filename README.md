# E-Bebek Product Carousel Demo

This project was originally created as part of a bootcamp final assignment.  
Although the full integration wasn’t completed, the core **product recommendation carousel** was built using only **vanilla JavaScript** — with API integration, dynamic rendering, favorite system, and CSS-in-JS styling.

## 🎯 Purpose

The goal was to simulate a “You May Also Like” product carousel, similar to those found on real e-commerce websites.  
It uses a real product API to fetch data and render it in a scrollable layout.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- HTML  
- JavaScript  
- CSS (injected via JS)  
- LocalStorage  
- [Random Product API](https://gist.githubusercontent.com/sevindi/.../products.json)

## 🧩 Features

- Fetches product data from API  
- Stores data in localStorage to avoid repeat calls  
- Builds DOM elements dynamically  
- Displays product name, price, discount percent  
- Includes left/right carousel scroll buttons  
- Favorites system via heart icon (persisted in localStorage)  
- Styles injected directly via JS  
- Error handling if critical HTML elements are missing

## 🧠 What I Learned

- Advanced DOM building using JavaScript  
- Client-side state management (localStorage)  
- API data formatting and condition-based rendering  
- Component-first thinking, even without a framework

## 👀 Why This Project Matters

Although not a complete app, this project showcases real front-end skills:  
working with APIs, localStorage, UI logic, and creating **an isolated, interactive e-commerce component.**

> It’s not perfect — but it reflects what I’ve learned, and how I think as a developer.
